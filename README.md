You beat her ass too? Why cant we team up or something?" -Ashton Kutcher "Because I beat her up in the bed. You know I had to do so much fucked up shit to her to get her to what she is now. Tell em george, he showed me how to do it and how to pick her out." -Jeffry Lane Flake

"I didn't have anything to do with hillary. But I would like to know what Mr. Kutcher would do for a little girl right now." -Paul Ryan "Are you really going to ask me that as Paul Ryan? There are spiders in here! I thought you just cleaned this place." -Ashton Kutcher "We cleaned this place for humans, bugs weren't a consideration." -Paul Ryan "I'm not kidding, I can get you a baby no charge. Your a star, but you have to be with me for three months as a young girl to pay for it." -Paul Ryan "What kind of creep are you?" -Ashton Kutcher "I have a girlfriend. She's about five years old. Do you think I care about what you'r here for at all?" -Paul Ryan

"I can't just sit here while darth vader does presentations on how he kills us. Stupid decisions to clean this room, it wasn't worth it. We could have had children in this room.
